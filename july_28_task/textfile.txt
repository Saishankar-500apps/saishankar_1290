EBS:Elastic block storage 
    EBS is a block level storage and persistent also
    whereas Instance storage is a temporary and block level storage
    when ever a instance is terminated instance storage gets deleted but ebs volume will present 
    but reterving data from instance is faster than ebs volumes
    for one instance mulitple ebs volumes can be attach and also for one ebs volume multiple ec2 instances can be attach
    cretaed a instance and vloume and attach to the instance 
    and created a snapshot and attached to the volume 
    restoring the data from snapshot
    snapshots follows incremantal backup
    all the snapshoprts are backup to S3 services only but those invisible to user
